 * Description for plausibility check:
 * System must take in 2 potentiometer values for accelerator and 2 values for brake.
 * System must check if either of the brake or accelerator position is above 5%
 * at the same time if both pedal positions are above 5%, disable
 * If okay, system should send torque request as normal.
 * Normal system operation: Map torque request based off of accelerometer position
 * and send torque request to inverter process.
